Verse 1:
In fields where the yams grow under the sun,
Farmers tread the land where the work is never done.
Facing the change in the wind and the rain,
Adapting their ways to ease the strain.  

Pre-Chorus:
Through trials and seasons, they learn to survive,
Finding new methods to keep dreams alive.  

Chorus:
Oh, hear the call of the earth and sky,
Yam farmers rise, reaching high.
With every choice, they find a way,
To face the climate, come what may.  

Verse 2:
The soil tells stories of years long past,
Guiding the hands that plant and cast.
With wisdom and courage, they stand strong,
In harmony with nature, where they belong.  

Pre-Chorus:
Resilient and steady, they pave the way,
For a future brighter, come a new day.  

Chorus:
Oh, hear the call of the earth and sky,
Yam farmers rise, reaching high.
With every choice, they find a way,
To face the climate, come what may.  

Bridge:
Sharing knowledge, side by side,
In communities where hope abides.
Together they conquer, together they strive,
For the earth, for the yams, keeping dreams alive.  

Chorus:
Oh, hear the call of the earth and sky,
Yam farmers rise, reaching high.
With every choice, they find a way,
To face the climate, come what may.  

Outro:
In the dance of the seasons, they stand tall,
Yam farmers united, answering the call.
Through change and challenge, their spirit stays,
Adapting and thriving, come what may.
