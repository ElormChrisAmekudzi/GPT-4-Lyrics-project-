Verse 1: The Struggle of the Farmer
Lyrics:
Sun beats down, the land dries up
Rain's uncertain, a bitter cup
Yam plants wither, a farmer's sigh
Climate's changing, the sky won't lie
Chorus: Adapting to the Change
Lyrics:
We must adapt, find a way to thrive
In this changing world, we'll survive
With knowledge and skill, we'll face the test
And protect our crops, for the very best
Verse 2: The Impact of Climate Change
Lyrics:
Pests invade, diseases spread
Yields are lower, a farmer's dread
Extreme weather, a constant threat
But hope remains, we won't forget
Chorus: Adapting to the Change
Lyrics:
We must adapt, find a way to thrive
In this changing world, we'll survive
With knowledge and skill, we'll face the test
And protect our crops, for the very best
Bridge: A Call to Action
Lyrics:
Let's work together, hand in hand
To protect our land, across the land
Sustainable practices, a greener way
For future generations, come what may
Chorus: Adapting to the Change
Lyrics:
We must adapt, find a way to thrive
In this changing world, we'll survive
With knowledge and skill, we'll face the test
And protect our crops, for the very best
